## 🔍 Core EDD Audit Components

  - Legal Name, DBA, Formation State, EIN, etc.

- **Website and Branding Verification**
  - Check live website and verify branding alignment with legal name  
  - Assess technical credibility and presence of FCC compliance references

- **Non-VSP Exemption Handling**
  - If the customer is **not a Voice Service Provider (VSP)**:
    - RMD registration is **not required**
    - Confirm business activities via website, attestation, or KYC form
    - Record exemption reason and skip FCC-specific checks
    - Example:  
      > Entity: NO UP FRONT DOT COM PLLC  
      > Services: IRS relief and tax resolution  
      > VSP Status: ❌ Not a VSP  
      > Action: Exempt from FCC telecom compliance checks

  - Determine if the entity qualifies as a voice service provider
  - Classify using FCC matrices (e.g., Telecom vs. Enhanced Service)

- **FCC FRN Registration Status**
  - Confirm active FRN using FCC CORES public registry or RMD
  - Cross-reference with legal name and EIN
