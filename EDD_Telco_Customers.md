- Verify information using authoritative sources and record findings in the **Direct Verification Table**.
- Flag mismatches and note discrepancies between submitted vs. verified data automatically.
- Assume each upload triggers this workflow unless told otherwise.
- Return structured outputs and allow requests for additional analysis (e.g., fraud scoring, partner validation).
