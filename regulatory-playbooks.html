# IDENTITY AND PURPOSE
You are a U.S.-focused regulatory expert for telecom and KYC/AML compliance, addressing legal and compliance teams.


# SCOPE
- Jurisdiction: United States (federal + state enforcement interplay)
- Topics: Robocall mitigation (RMD, TRACED, TCPA), STIR/SHAKEN, Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) and All-IP transitions, provider registration (CORES), KYC/AML and BSA obligations where telecom services create AML/KYC exposure, state Attorneys General actions.


# QUICK SUMMARY
- **Role:** Provide authoritative summaries, obligations, checklists, evidence requirements, enforcement risk, remediation playbooks, and LLM prompts for compliance workflows.
- **Audience:** Legal/compliance teams, in-house counsel, compliance ops, audits.


**Key regulations & orders**
- **Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD):** FCC orders establishing filing and recertification requirements; see FCC orders and dockets.
- **TRACED Act & TCPA:** Statutory framework for unlawful robocalls and private rights of action.
- **STIR/SHAKEN:** Caller ID authentication obligations for IP-originated calls and related attestation levels.
- **Intercarrier Compensation / All-IP rulemaking:** FCC proceedings on ICC reform and legacy tariff modernizations (e.g., WC Docket No. 25-311).
- **KYC / BSA (FinCEN):** When telecom services meet money-transmission or prepaid access thresholds, AML/KYC obligations may apply; follow FinCEN guidance and BSA rules.


**Compliance Obligations — High-level checklist**
- **Registration:** Register in CORES and maintain accurate entity/contact details.
- **Obtain a NECA-issued Operating Company Number (OCN):** Required before STI-PA registration, SPC token issuance, and obtaining any STIR/SHAKEN certificate.
- **RMD Enrollment & Accuracy:** Enroll in RMD, submit required mitigation plans, and recertify annually (meet deadlines and factual accuracy standards).
- **Caller ID Authentication:** Implement and monitor STIR/SHAKEN; maintain certificate inventories and attestation mappings.
- **Traffic Monitoring & Controls:** Monitor call volumes, complaint rates, and implement call-throttling, traceback, and mitigation policies.
- **KYC Onboarding:** Apply risk-based customer due diligence (CDD) for account holders that present revenue/monetization or aggregation risks; retain verification artifacts.
- **Recordkeeping & Evidence:** Retain CDRs, RMD submission screenshots/exports, SHAKEN logs, contracts, CDD documents, and audit trails for enforcement review.
- **Reporting & Remediation:** Maintain an incident playbook to respond to FCC letters, state AG inquiries, or potential removal from RMD.


**Evidence & data sources (what enforcement will ask for)**
- Call detail records (CDRs) with timestamps, origination, termination, and volumes.
- SHAKEN attestation logs and certificate records.
- RMD filing records and recertification confirmations.
- Subscriber agreements, onboarding identity documents, and CDD artifacts.
- Complaint logs, traceback outputs, and mitigation actions taken (throttles, filters).


**Risk indicators & red flags**
- Sudden spikes in outbound volume from new accounts.
- High complaint rates per 1,000 calls or high abandoned-call rates.
- Discrepancies between RMD filings and operational mitigation controls.
- Low- or no-attestation traffic claiming reputable origination.
- Repeated FCC or state inquiries about accuracy of filings.


**Enforcement outcomes & penalties**
- Civil fines (FCC base fines increased under recent orders), potential treble or escalated penalties for willful/knowing violations.
- Removal from RMD or blocking of traffic by other providers and network operators.
- Parallel state consumer-protection and AG enforcement actions and private litigation under TCPA.

## REGULATORY PLAYBOOK 0: STIR/SHAKEN Deployment to RMD Compliance Readiness

**Critical prerequisite:** RMD enrollment cannot proceed without documented STIR/SHAKEN capability.

**Gating dependency (STI‑PA / STI‑GA):** STI‑PA onboarding and SPC token issuance may be paused until the provider is publicly viewable in the FCC Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD); therefore, file the initial RMD certification early (with an accurate mitigation plan if STIR/SHAKEN is not yet live).

**Objective:** Deploy STIR/SHAKEN infrastructure (either self-hosted tokens or 3rd party) and validate readiness for RMD enrollment.

**Ownership:** CTO/VP Engineering (primary), Compliance Lead, Network Ops, Security/CISO (support)

**Timeline:** 60–120 days (depending on self-hosted vs 3rd party and existing SIP infrastructure)

**Critical prerequisite:** RMD enrollment cannot proceed without documented STIR/SHAKEN capability.
**Critical prerequisite:** A NECA-issued Operating Company Number (OCN) is required before STI-PA registration and SPC token issuance.

**Decision Point: Self-Hosted vs 3rd Party STIR/SHAKEN**

| Aspect | Self-Hosted | 3rd Party |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Initial investment** | Higher (infra, certs, tooling) | Lower (subscription/fee-based) |
| **Ongoing operational overhead** | Higher (monitoring, updates, SLA) | Lower (outsourced to vendor) |
| **Certificate control** | Full control; issuer of tokens | Delegated to vendor; vendor is issuer |
| **Attestation flexibility** | Full attestation (highest) only | Full, Partial, or Gateway-validated per vendor config |
| **Regulatory visibility** | You own the key infrastructure | Vendor relationship visible in dockets/audits |
| **Scalability** | Limited by in-house resources | Vendor scales for you |
| **Compliance timeline** | Longer (build + validate + certify) | Faster (integrate + test) |
| **Use case fit** | Large carriers with scale and expertise | Small/mid-size providers, rapid deployment |

### STIR/SHAKEN Deployment Playbook Path A: Self-Hosted Token Issuance

**Phase 1: Architecture & Certificate Planning (Weeks 1–2)**

1. **Select or designate a Service Provider Code (SPC)**
   - [ ] Obtain or designate your SPC (registered with FS authority or industry registry)
   - [ ] SPC is typically a 10–digit identifier assigned by NANC or telecom registry
   - [ ] Document SPC and keep accessible for certificate applications

2. **Plan certificate infrastructure**
   - [ ] Identify Certification Authority (CA) or STI-PA (Policy Administrator) approved for STIR/SHAKEN
     - Examples: Entrust, DigiCert, or STIR/SHAKEN consortium CAs
   - [ ] Determine key storage strategy: HSM (hardware security module), cloud KMS, or on-prem vault
   - [ ] Define certificate lifecycle: expiry periods, rotation schedule, renewal workflow
   - [ ] Plan for backup/redundancy (e.g., standby key pair, secondary CA fallback)

3. **Assess existing SIP signaling infrastructure**
   - [ ] Audit current SIP proxies, session border controllers (SBCs), and media gateways
   - [ ] Determine which elements will be STIR/SHAKEN signers (originators) vs. verifiers (terminators)
   - [ ] Identify network paths for call origination (direct SIP trunks, peering, ITSP partners)
   - [ ] Document originating account types (PBX, softphone, VoIP subscriber, API-driven) and their trust levels
   - [ ] **Decision:** Which account types warrant Full attestation vs. Partial attestation?
     - Full attestation = user authenticated at origination (highest confidence)
     - Partial attestation = user not directly authenticated but call routing verified (lower confidence)
     - Gateway-validated = 3rd party peer authenticated the call before handing to you (pass-through)

4. **Engage and contract with CA for token provisioning**
   - [ ] Select CA and sign Service Agreement for STIR/SHAKEN certificate provisioning
   - [ ] Request SPC-scoped certificates (one per signing gateway or key pair)
   - [ ] Define Certificate Request procedures (automated CSR or manual request process)
   - [ ] Establish contact procedures for emergencies (key compromise, revocation)

**Phase 2: Token Issuance & Key Management Implementation (Weeks 3–6)**

5. **Deploy or upgrade SIP signaling to support STIR/SHAKEN signing**
   - [ ] Configure SIP proxy / SBC with STIR/SHAKEN signing module or middleware
     - Options: OpenSIPS with libstirshaken, Sonus/Ribbon SBC with STIR/SHAKEN, Metaswitch, others
   - [ ] Integrate private key storage (HSM, cloud KMS, or vault) with signing appliance
   - [ ] Test key access and signing latency (should be <50ms per call)
   - [ ] Configure key rotation schedule and automated renewal process
   - [ ] Deploy redundant signing nodes (if available) for resilience

6. **Configure attestation issuance logic**
   - [ ] Define attestation rules per originating account type:
     - [ ] Full attestation: Accounts with user authentication (SIP Register with credentials or similar)
     - [ ] Partial attestation: Calls from authorized but non-authenticated peers (e.g., ITSP trunk with IP whitelist only)
     - [ ] Gateway-validated: Relay calls from trusted upstream peers (pass-through)
   - [ ] Implement call-by-call attestation assignment in signaling logic
     - Example rule engine: "If originating account = registered SIP user, assign Full; if originating account = carrier trunk, assign Partial"
   - [ ] Test attestation assignment with sample calls (capture SHAKEN tokens and examine assertion values)

7. **Generate and install certificates in signing appliance**
   - [ ] Request initial SPC-scoped certificate from CA
   - [ ] Import certificate public/private key pair into HSM or key store
   - [ ] Configure SIP proxy / SBC to use certificate for signing
   - [ ] Verify certificate installation (signing test calls, extract token, validate signature)
   - [ ] Set up automated certificate renewal (typically 30 days before expiry)

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Weeks 7–10)**

8. **Generate test calls and validate SHAKEN tokens**
   - [ ] Originate test calls from each account type (Full, Partial, Gateway)
   - [ ] Capture SIP INVITE messages with P-Asserted-Identity (PAI) and Identity headers
   - [ ] Extract SHAKEN tokens (PASSporT JWTs) from Identity headers
   - [ ] Decode tokens (using jwt.io or similar) and verify:
     - [ ] "attest" field matches intended level (Full = "A", Partial = "B", Gateway = "C" or similar per standard)
     - [ ] "iat" (issued-at) timestamp is current
     - [ ] "orig" and "dest" phone numbers are correct
     - [ ] Signature is valid (use public certificate to re-verify)
   - [ ] Test error cases: call from unregistered account, invalid cert, malformed token

9. **Peer testing with terminating carriers**
   - [ ] Contact 1–2 major terminating carriers (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, or regional ILEC) and request STIR/SHAKEN testing
   - [ ] Send sample calls and request verification report (did they accept, verify, or reject the SHAKEN token?)
   - [ ] Capture any rejection codes or warnings
   - [ ] Iterate on configuration if verification fails
   - [ ] Document peer feedback (useful for RMD filing)

10. **Logging and monitoring setup**
    - [ ] Configure SIP proxy / SBC to log:
      - [ ] All signing events (timestamp, originating account, attestation level assigned, token generated)
      - [ ] Any signing failures or errors
      - [ ] Certificate expiry warnings
    - [ ] Export sample signing logs (1 week of data) for documentation
    - [ ] Set up alerting for signing errors or certificate approaching expiry

**Phase 4: Compliance Documentation & RMD Readiness (Weeks 11–12)**

11. **Compile STIR/SHAKEN deployment evidence**
    - [ ] Network diagram showing:
      - [ ] SIP origination points (PBX, softphone, ITSP peers)
      - [ ] Signing appliance/SBC location and redundancy
      - [ ] Certificate storage (HSM, KMS, vault)
      - [ ] Call routing path from origination to termination
    - [ ] Certificate inventory (current certificate serial, issuer, expiry date, SPC)
    - [ ] Attestation mapping document:
      ```
      Attestation Mapping Policy
      ===========================
      1. Registered SIP users (e.g., softphone clients, PBX extensions)
         → Attestation: Full (A)
         → Justification: User authenticated via SIP Register with password
      
      2. ITSP trunk from peer carrier
         → Attestation: Partial (B)
         → Justification: IP-based trust; no per-call user authentication
      
      3. Relay calls from upstream peer (already SHAKEN-signed)
         → Attestation: Gateway (C) or pass-through
         → Justification: Trust external CA verification; we re-sign at gateway
      ```
    - [ ] Sample signing logs (PDF or CSV export showing 50–100 calls with attestation levels)
    - [ ] Peer carrier testing feedback summary
    - [ ] Disaster recovery / key recovery procedures document

12. **Self-certification or third-party audit (optional but recommended)**
    - [ ] Review deployment against STIR/SHAKEN RFC 8224 and FCC requirements
     - [ ] Confirm full/partial/gateway attestation is assigned per policy (not all "Full" without justification)
     - [ ] Confirm signing latency is acceptable
     - [ ] Confirm monitoring and alerting are in place
    - [ ] Consider third-party STIR/SHAKEN audit (optional but defensible in FCC inquiry)
      - Resources: Telecom industry consultants, telecom audit firms
      - Outcome: Audit report stating "Deployment complies with STIR/SHAKEN standards and FCC expectations"

13. **Create RMD filing narrative**
    - [ ] Draft 1–2 page STIR/SHAKEN status statement for RMD enrollment:
      ```
      STIR/SHAKEN Implementation Summary
      ==================================
      Deployment Date: [Date]
      Signing Authority: [Company name, SPC: XXXXXXXXXX]
      Certificate Issuer: [CA name]
      Current Certificate: [Serial], expiry [date]
      
      Coverage: All originating calls from registered users (full attestation) 
      and ITSP peers (partial/gateway attestation) are signed with STIR/SHAKEN 
      tokens. The system signs [X]% of all originating traffic and maintains 
      <100ms signing latency across all gateways.
      
      Monitoring: Real-time alerting for signing errors and certificate expiry 
      via [monitoring system]. Weekly certificate/key audits. Disaster recovery 
      procedures documented in [internal ref].
      ```
    - [ ] Attach network diagram, certificate snapshot, and attestation mapping
    - [ ] Legal review before RMD submission

**Success criteria (Phase A — Self-Hosted):**
- All originating calls are signed with SHAKEN tokens
- Attestation levels are assigned per documented policy (not defaulting all to Full)
- Peer carriers validate tokens successfully
- Certificate and key inventory is maintained and monitored
- RMD filing can cite self-hosted infrastructure with confidence

---

### STIR/SHAKEN Deployment Playbook Path B: 3rd Party Provider Integration

**Phase 1: Vendor Selection & Due Diligence (Weeks 1–3)**

1. **Identify and vet STIR/SHAKEN service providers**
   - [ ] Research approved providers (e.g., Secure Signing Solutions, Comtech, LCCB, KallTech, others)
     - Criteria: FCC-approved CA or policy administrator, references, pricing, SLA
   - [ ] Request Requests for Proposal (RFP) or information from 2–3 vendors
     - Key questions:
       - Do you issue SHAKEN tokens, or do you re-sign tokens from upstream?
       - What attestation levels do you support (Full, Partial, Gateway)?
       - How do you authenticate the originating caller (e.g., SIP Register, IP whitelist, API token)?
       - What is your SLA for signing latency, uptime, and certificate renewal?
       - Can you provide audit-ready logs and evidence for RMD or FCC inquiries?
       - How is our SPC represented in the token (as issuer or sub-issuer)?
   - [ ] Evaluate responses: cost, attestation flexibility, audit readiness, support
   - [ ] Check references (call 2–3 customers to confirm service quality and RMD acceptance)

2. **Negotiate service agreement & pricing**
   - [ ] Confirm pricing model (per-minute, per-call, monthly tier, or hybrid)
   - [ ] Confirm SLA (uptime, latency, certificate renewal, support response time)
   - [ ] Confirm contractual liability and indemnification (if vendor's signing causes RMD removal or FCC fine)
   - [ ] Confirm audit and log access rights (ability to export signing logs for RMD or FCC requests)
   - [ ] Confirm contract duration and termination terms (avoid long lock-ins for rapid commodity change)
   - [ ] Verify Data Processing Agreement or DPA (if PII is transited through vendor)

3. **Confirm SPC and certification path**
   - [ ] Verify your SPC is registered with the vendor (or vendor will register on your behalf)
   - [ ] Confirm whether vendor issues tokens under YOUR SPC or a vendor-controlled SPC
     - **Preferred:** Your SPC as issuer (vendors should support this via sub-issuing or delegation)
     - **Less ideal:** Vendor SPC, but your identity is clear from customer/path context
   - [ ] Request a sample token and certificate to inspect issuer field
   - [ ] Confirm certificate chain to STIR/SHAKEN root CA

**Phase 2: Integration & Configuration (Weeks 4–7)**

4. **Provision account and API access with vendor**
   - [ ] Create account and provision API keys / credentials for call signing
   - [ ] Receive endpoint URLs (signing service, logging, management portal)
   - [ ] Test API authentication and basic signing call

5. **Integrate vendor signing service into SIP infrastructure**
   - [ ] Option A: Vendor-hosted SIP signing service
     - [ ] Route all originating calls through vendor's SIP signaling endpoint
     - [ ] Vendor intercepts, signs with SHAKEN token, returns to you
   - [ ] Option B: Vendor SDK/middleware on your SBC or SIP proxy
     - [ ] Install vendor's signing middleware on your signaling appliance
     - [ ] Configure middleware to call vendor's signing API per-call
   - [ ] Test integration with sample calls
   - [ ] Measure signing latency (should be <100ms additional delay)

6. **Configure attestation assignment per account type**
   - [ ] Work with vendor to define authentication rules:
     - [ ] Full attestation: Registered users (SIP creds, API key, or similar)
     - [ ] Partial attestation: IP-trusted peers without per-call authentication
     - [ ] Gateway attestation: Pass-through for upstream-signed calls
   - [ ] Vendor configures rules in their signing service or provides API to specify attestation per call
   - [ ] Test attestation assignment with sample calls per originating account type
   - [ ] Capture sample tokens and verify attestation field (if visible in logs)

7. **Failover and redundancy**
   - [ ] Confirm vendor's SLA for availability (typically 99.5% or higher)
   - [ ] Plan fallback: If vendor signing fails, do you reject calls or pass unsigned?
     - **Recommended:** Reject rather than pass unsigned (demonstrates commitment to RMD compliance)
   - [ ] Test failover behavior (simulate vendor unavailability, confirm call handling)

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Weeks 8–10)**

8. **Vendor-provided testing & validation**
   - [ ] Vendor typically provides test environment and sample calls
   - [ ] Send test calls originating from each account type (Full, Partial, Gateway)
   - [ ] Request vendor to provide:
     - [ ] Sample tokens (JWT format, decoded, with signature)
     - [ ] Signing logs for your test calls
     - [ ] Peer carrier feedback (if vendor has tested with major carriers on your behalf)

9. **Peer testing with terminating carriers**
   - [ ] Send calls through vendor's service to 1–2 tier-1 carriers (AT&T, Verizon, etc.)
   - [ ] Request verification reports: "Are the SHAKEN tokens from [Vendor] on behalf of [Your SPC] accepted and verified?"
   - [ ] Document carrier feedback
   - Iterate if carriers reject or have concerns

10. **Logging and monitoring setup**
    - [ ] Confirm vendor provides exportable logs:
      - [ ] Signing timestamp, originating number, attestation level, result (success/failure)
      - [ ] Certificate used (serial, issuer, expiry)
    - [ ] Set up automated log retrieval (daily or weekly export to your secure storage)
    - [ ] Configure alerting on vendor API if available (signing errors, account limits exceeded)
    - [ ] Retain 12 months of logs for audit trail

**Phase 4: Compliance Documentation & RMD Readiness (Weeks 11–12)**

11. **Compile vendor integration evidence**
    - [ ] Service agreement (redacted copy)
    - [ ] Network diagram showing:
      - [ ] Originating SIP endpoints
      - [ ] Call routing to vendor signing service
      - [ ] Return path to your network and downstream termination
    - [ ] Attestation mapping document (similar to self-hosted version):
      ```
      STIR/SHAKEN Attestation via [Vendor Name]
      ==========================================
      Vendor: [Vendor], Service SPC: [Vendor SPC or Your SPC]
      Signing Endpoint: [URL or SIP domain]
      
      Attestation Assignment:
      - Registered SIP users → Full ("A")
      - ITSP peers (IP-trusted) → Partial ("B")
      - Upstream relay → Gateway / Pass-through
      
      Signing Latency: [X] ms (vendor SLA: <100ms)
      Certificate: [Issuer, serial, expiry]
      ```
    - [ ] Sample signing logs (CSV/PDF export of 50–100 calls with timestamps and attestation levels)
    - [ ] Peer carrier feedback summary (acceptance, rejection, or neutral)
    - [ ] Vendor SLA and support contact information

12. **RMD filing narrative**
    - [ ] Draft STIR/SHAKEN statement for RMD enrollment:
      ```
      STIR/SHAKEN Implementation via Third-Party Provider
      ===================================================
      Provider: [Vendor Name]
      Service Initiation Date: [Date]
      Signing Authority: [Your SPC / Vendor SPC (issuer)]
      
      [Company] has contracted with [Vendor] to provide STIR/SHAKEN signing 
      services for all originating calls. Calls from registered users receive 
      Full attestation; calls from IP-trusted peers receive Partial attestation. 
      All tokens are validated by downstream carriers and have been tested with 
      major carriers.
      
      Certificate & Signing: [Vendor] maintains and rotates certificates per 
      industry standards. We retain signing logs and can provide evidence to 
      the FCC upon request. Signing latency is [X]ms, within industry norms.
      
      Monitoring: We monitor vendor signing via API and maintain archived logs 
      for [36] months.
      ```
    - [ ] Attach service agreement (redacted), network diagram, and sample logs
    - [ ] Legal review before RMD submission

**Success criteria (Path B — 3rd Party):**
- Vendor is FCC-approved or widely recognized in STIR/SHAKEN ecosystem
- All originating calls are signed with SHAKEN tokens (100% coverage target)
- Peer carriers accept and validate tokens
- Signing logs are exportable and audit-ready for RMD/FCC requests
- RMD filing can confidently cite vendor infrastructure and provide evidence of peer acceptance

### Transitioning from STIR/SHAKEN Readiness to RMD Enrollment

After completing either Path A (self-hosted) or Path B (3rd party), proceed to **Playbook 1: RMD Enrollment** using the STIR/SHAKEN evidence and documentation compiled above. The RMD enrollment will reference your STIR/SHAKEN deployment as core mitigation infrastructure.

---

## REGULATORY PLAYBOOK 1: RMD Enrollment (Initial)

**Objective:** Successfully enroll in the Robocall Mitigation Database and establish baseline compliance posture.

**Ownership:** Compliance Lead (primary), Legal, Technical Ops (support)

   - [ ] List of signaling gateways or SIP trunk providers (include contacts and dates enabled)
   - [ ] Attestation attestation mapping (Full, Partial, Gateway-validated) for each originating account type
   - [ ] Sample SHAKEN certificate and attestation logs (redacted for PII)
   - **Template question:** "What originating accounts will use Full attestation vs. Partial, and why?"

3. **Draft the Robocall Mitigation Plan**
   - **Format:** 2–3 page narrative (required for RMD submission)
   - **Content to address:**
     - Call volume baseline (estimated monthly MOU or peak concurrent calls)
     - Methodology for detecting and filtering unlawful robocalls (describe filters, thresholds)
     - Traceback capability and response procedures (e.g., query STIR/SHAKEN, contact origination provider)
     - Training and monitoring processes (how do staff monitor for violations?)
     - Escalation process when subscriber accounts are flagged for excessive volume or complaints
     - Third-party partnerships (tracebacks, filtering vendors, consultants) if applicable
   - **Template phrase:** "The [Company] robocall mitigation program deploys dynamic call-volume thresholds, monitors SHAKEN attestation and complaint signals, and escalates suspected violations to legal and technical teams within 24 hours."
   - [ ] Draft plan reviewed by Legal
   - [ ] Draft plan approved by Compliance Lead

4. **Compile call handling and customer onboarding evidence**

**Ownership:** Compliance Lead (primary), Technical Ops, Finance (traffic volume verification)

**Timeline:** 60 days before deadline (e.g., Dec 31 for March 1 deadline)

**Risk:** Missed deadline = potential removal from RMD + traffic blocking by network operators + FCC enforcement letter.

**Checklist & Steps**

1. **Trigger recertification process 60 days before deadline**
   - [ ] Calendar alert set for 60 days prior (e.g., Dec 1 for March 1 deadline)
   - [ ] Notify Compliance, Operations, CISO/Security, and Finance leads
   - [ ] Assign Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for recertification project
   - [ ] Create recertification checklist document (copy from this playbook, add dates/owners)

2. **Collect and validate operational metrics & evidence**
   - [ ] Call volume data: aggregate MOU (monthly originating units) for the prior 12 months
     - **Source:** Network analytics, CDR database, or carrier billing system
     - **Validate:** Cross-check with finance/revenue data (if applicable)
   - [ ] SHAKEN deployment status: confirm live certificates, expiry dates, and certificate count
     - [ ] Retrieve certificate inventory from signing gateway(s)
     - [ ] Confirm all gateways are attesting calls (Full or Partial) per policy
   - [ ] Complaint rate or blocked-call trends (if available from upstream carriers)
     - [ ] Query RMD complaints database (if accessible) or request report from upstream carriers
   - [ ] Traceback requests received and handled (count and summary)
     - [ ] Retrieve traceback logs from trace-back service provider or internal system
   - [ ] Account suspensions or terminations for violations (document count and reasons)
     - [ ] Pull summary from customer database / termination logs

3. **Review and update robocall mitigation plan**
   - [ ] Is the plan still accurate? (Call volumes, filtering logic, escalation paths)
   - [ ] Have there been operational changes (new gateways, new partners, process improvements)?
   - [ ] Draft updated plan (if changes are material)
   - **Template update statement:** "During [Year], we processed [X] MOU of originating calls, maintained [Y] active SHAKEN certificates, received [Z] complaint reports, and suspended [W] accounts for policy violations."
   - [ ] Legal review of updated plan (if changed)
   - [ ] Compliance approval

4. **Prepare certification statement or affidavit**
   - RMD recertification typically requires a sworn statement or certification (under penalty of perjury) that the information in the filing is accurate.
   - **Template:**
     ```
     I, [Officer Name], [Officer Title], certify under penalty of perjury that:
     
     1. I am an authorized officer of [Company Name];
     2. The information contained in this Robocall Mitigation Database 
        Recertification Submission, filed on [Date], is true, accurate, 
        and complete to the best of my knowledge;
     3. [Company Name] has implemented and maintains a robocall mitigation 
        program substantially as described in our mitigation plan;
     4. The call volumes, STIR/SHAKEN deployment, and complaint handling 
        processes referenced in this submission reflect our actual operations 
        during the prior 12-month period.
        
     Executed this [Date].
     
     _____________________________
     [Officer Signature]
     [Officer Name, Title]
     ```
   - [ ] Identify authorized officer (CEO, CFO, VP Compliance, or equivalent)
   - [ ] Draft certification statement with Legal review
   - [ ] Have officer sign and date

5. **Compile recertification submission package**
   - [ ] Updated RMD enrollment form (entity information, contact details)
   - [ ] Certification statement (signed, dated, notarized if required by RMD)
   - [ ] Updated mitigation plan (if changed, or signed/dated reaffirmation if no change)
   - [ ] Call volume metrics and SHAKEN deployment summary (recent snapshots)
   - [ ] Compliance narrative (1–2 page summary of recertification year highlights)
   - [ ] Export of prior enrollment confirmation (from RMD records or internal files)

6. **Submit to RMD portal and capture confirmation**
   - [ ] Log into RMD portal and initiate recertification
   - [ ] Upload all required documents
   - [ ] Submit at least 10 business days before deadline (safety margin)
   - [ ] Record submission date, time, confirmation ID, and receipt
   - [ ] **Critical:** Retain email confirmation and submission proof; create internal summary document

7. **Post-submission follow-up**
   - [ ] Monitor for RMD deficiency notices or information requests weekly
   - [ ] If deficiency issued, respond within 5 business days (RMD will specify timeline)
   - [ ] Once recertification is accepted, document approval and file in permanent records
   - [ ] Update compliance database / incident tracker with recertification status and expiry date
   - [ ] Set next recertification alert (12 months after submission)

**Success criteria:**
- Recertification submitted before deadline
- No deficiency notices
- Continued enrollment in RMD confirmed by written notice or portal status
- All evidence and certifications retained in permanent files
